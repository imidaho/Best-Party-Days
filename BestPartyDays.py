# PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
# Must include a README file that states the following:
# What question are you answering or problem are you analyzing
# A brief overview of how you accomplished this, including any necessary background for someone to understand the problem, where your data came from, what you used from that data, any analysis you applied to the data, and what you chose to visualize/display/report in the final product
# Any special requirements, dependencies, or steps to run the project
# You must include a SQL database (MySQL or SQLite) where your data will be stored
# You need to include the script that sets up/creates your database
# You must include a Python script used to fetch data from a data source and load it into your SQL database
# Your data source may be an external API, database, a CSV file, or any other data source that you can read/parse via Python code
# You must include a Python script to retrieve the data from your SQL database into a Python object
# Visualize the results of your analysis using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh or another Python Data Visualization library. Your results cannot be a plain text representation and you are encouraged to explore a visualization approach that clearly supports a conclusion/result of the analysis of your data.
# Your data retrieval for visualization uses at least one SQL query, meaning you can't parse records from your data set using only Python or an ORM. Pushing and retrieving an entire dataframe to and from SQL also does not meet the requirement, e.g. the SQL query should not simply be SELECT * FROM database
# Your project code is on your GitHub account in its own repository

# import libraries:
import requests
import datetime

# create function to determine API request for each day needed for calculations- All saturdays, sundays, and holiday mondays, 12pm-10pm from 2008, 2018 [seperate script to do before-hand and create a json or csv?]
#####Need to watch json vids####

    #                     Labor Day: first Monday in September
    #                     Columbus Day: second Monday in October (formerly observed in some states on October 12)
    #                     Veterans Day: fourth Monday in October


# stores each desired day in a variable that we can use to call the dark sky API for historical weather data of that day
# ask API to return data for that day and time slice.
