What is the best weekend of the year to have an outdoor party in Louisville?
    assumptions:    
            party will take place on Saturday or Sunday and on holiday mondays ex: labor day)
                Monday Holidays to include:
                        Washington's Birthday: third Monday in February (formerly February 22)
                        Memorial Day: last Monday in May (formerly May 30)
                        Labor Day: first Monday in September
                        Columbus Day: second Monday in October (formerly observed in some states on October 12)
                        Veterans Day: fourth Monday in October
            Party will start after noon and end by 10 pm
            ideal temperature range for the duration of the party : 65-80 degrees F
            ideal humidity range from 75-80 deg F?
            history of rain events during time frame is an indication of risk
    methods: 
            Calculate dates to pull, (104+5 dates)* 5 =  545 (104+5 dates)* 10 = 
            pull weekend and monday holiday weather history from noon to 10pm (past 5 years? 10 years?)
                humidity, temp range, precipitation, sunset
            correspond weekend days with each other over past 5 years ex. Sat_one, Sun_one, Sat_two, Sun_two thru Sat_52
            (Sat_one, {hi_temp:(25, 42, 38, 50, 21)}, {low_temp: (20, 35, 40, 10)]}, {precipitation: (yes, no, no, no, yes)
            graphing
                if hi-temp average > 80, or low_temp average < 65:
                    don't graph
                else display range, mean, average, precipitation events, and sunset_time
                finally: highlight projected top five weekend days of 2019, 2020, and 2021, and their sunset times
            scoring
                top 5 weekend days by range and precipitation events
                **How to score?**
                    lowest precipitation events in time frame?
                    or think bigger?
